# CSCI 213 Lab 10: Working with Git
## Author: Caleb Coleman   

**This is the Git lab for CSCI 213 Software Development. One class was added, Car.java,**
**which extends the abstract Vehicle class. The Car class contains the following:**


* two instance variables
* a parameterized constructor for all current and super instance variables
* getters for the instance variables in this class
* the toString method
* the equals method
* a copy method
